# Nested Records

branches can depend on each other. branch is a name for piece of structure inside a dataset. Imagine that a dataset is a grove of trees, and each tree is made up of branches connected to each other. Branch is called a trunk if it has leaves - branches that describe it. A branch without leaves is called a twig and sits at the very top of the tree. A branch that does not describe any other branch and thus does not have a trunk, is called a root and sits at the very bottom of a tree.

Let's add an `age` to a `name` of a person that experienced an event.

> `.csvs.csv`
``` csv
csvs,0.0.2
```

> `_-_.csv`
``` csv
event,date
event,name
name,age
```

> `event-date.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,2001-01-01
climbed Everest,2003-03-03
```

> `event-name.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,Donell
climbed Everest,Eva
```

> `name-age.csv`
``` csv
Donell,35
Eva,70
```

Now, let's add a favorite quote of each person, and the author of each quote 

> `.csvs.csv`
``` csv
csvs,0.0.2
```

> `_-_.csv`
``` csv
event,date
event,name
name,age
name,quote
quote,author
```

> `event-date.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,2001-01-01
climbed Everest,2003-03-03
```

> `event-name.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,Donell
climbed Everest,Eva
```

> `name-age.csv`
``` csv
Donell,35
Eva,70
```

> `name-quote.csv`
``` csv
Donell,The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Eva,"Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground, and start over"
```

> `quote-author.csv`
``` csv
The only way to do great work is to love what you do,Donovan
"Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground, and start over",Celeste Ng
```

You can even define a recursive relation to specify the parent of each person

> `.csvs.csv`
``` csv
csvs,0.0.2
```

> `_-_.csv`
``` csv
event,date
event,name
name,age
name,parent
```

> `event-date.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,2001-01-01
climbed Everest,2003-03-03
```

> `event-name.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,Donell
climbed Everest,Eva
```

> `name-parent.csv`
``` csv
Donell,Jack
Donell,Jacqueline
Jack,Rona
Jack,Bernard
Jacqueline,Leif
Jacqueline,Fatuma
Eva,Ismail
Eva,Hauwa
Ismail,Nelson
Ismail,Dennis
Hauwa,Rabi
Hauwa,Louis
```
