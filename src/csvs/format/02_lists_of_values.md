# Lists of Values

repeat a line with the same key to represent a list of values. For example, let's say Donell visited Japan every year for three years. 

> `.csvs.csv`
``` csv
csvs,0.0.2
```

> `_-_.csv`
``` csv
event,date
event,name
branch,description
```

> `event-date.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,2001-01-01
visited Japan,2002-02-02
visited Japan,2003-03-03
climbed Everest,2003-03-03
```

> `event-name.csv`
``` csv
visited Japan,Donell
climbed Everest,Eva
```

Notice that the year 2003 repeats two times - once in the list of events about Japan, and once in the list of events about Everest. Be careful when you add new branches that describe the date "2003-03-03" - they might apply to both mentions!

To avoid conflicts, make sure to use unique identifiers when you want singleton values. For example, use a [unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) as a key.

empty value is a value, one comma is empty key to an empty value

empty line is not a value
